# kf
Kalman filtering implementation in python for battery state estimation (Standard KF, EKF and Sigma Point). Following examples from Greg Plett at University of Colorado class on Battery Modeling and BMS Algorithims ([ECE5720: Battery Management and Control](http://mocha-java.uccs.edu/ECE5720/index.html))

This work extends the work of a python version of Greg Pletts enhanced self correcting cell model toolbox available here (Python ESC)[https://github.com/batterysim/esctoolbox-python], and original Matlab/Octave Version here (ESC Toolbox)[http://mocha-java.uccs.edu/BMS2/]

This repository is an exercise in porting the Matlab/Octave code to python to further understand the models and estimation algortihims and make them available in Python for personal use.
